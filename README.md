-What
Final Project

-Why

We wanted to design something that someone might use if it were developed more/refined, as of now its rudementary in a relative sense to what it could be.

The predicate of the program was to allow employees of companies/organizaitons to review each other in an anonymous manner. For example this could prevent a tyrant boss/employee to perperaute his negative impact, while maintainng employee comfortability and security in the workplace etc. 

Could also improve efficiency/productivity etc
Employee reviews, last controbutions are considered some of the criterion that this program uses that could improve employee efficiency/comfortability/security.
